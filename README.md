## cpnt262-ach7, Reusable Vue Components

### Challenges I Faced

- I did not understand props until I looked into them some more
    - Rewatched the portion of class that we used them
    - Looked back at class notes
    - Looked at some sites including:
        - [Vuejs Props](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.html#props)
        - [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-props-in-vuejs/)
    - I now know how to use them, and how they make it so I can reuse components, they are very important
- Another issue I'm having is my button not looking like a button
    - I added a background color so its doesn't just look like normal text
